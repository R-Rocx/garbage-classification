# garbage-classification
Garbage classification is the systematic process of categorizing waste materials based on their properties, origin, or potential for reuse and recycling. The goal is to sort waste into different streams (e.g., wet, dry, hazardous) to facilitate efficient management, maximize resource recovery, and minimize environmental harm. 
Key Classification Types
Waste is generally categorized based on several criteria:
By Biodegradability:
Biodegradable Waste: Items that can decompose naturally through the action of microorganisms (e.g., food scraps, yard waste, paper, cardboard).
Non-biodegradable Waste: Materials that do not decompose naturally or do so very slowly and remain in the environment for a long time (e.g., plastics, glass, metals, certain chemicals).
By Origin/Source:
Domestic Waste: Generated in households (e.g., kitchen waste, packaging).
Industrial Waste: Byproducts from factories and manufacturing processes (e.g., chemical solvents, paints, metals).
Commercial Waste: From offices, shops, and institutions (e.g., paper, cardboard, food waste).
Health/Biomedical Waste: From hospitals and clinics (e.g., gloves, syringes, infectious materials).
E-Waste: Discarded electronic devices (e.g., batteries, circuit boards).
By Properties/Hazardousness:
Hazardous Waste: Contains properties that are potentially harmful to human health or the environment (e.g., toxic chemicals, some batteries, flammable materials).
Non-hazardous Waste: Materials considered safe for general handling and disposal. 
The Role of AI in Classification
Artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision and machine learning, is increasingly used to automate and improve garbage classification. AI systems can analyze images and data from sensors to rapidly and accurately identify different waste materials, which enhances recycling rates and reduces contamination. This technology powers: 
Automated Sorting Systems: Robots with AI-powered cameras can identify and sort waste items much faster and more accurately than manual sorting.
Smart Bins: Bins equipped with sensors use AI to detect fill levels and waste types, optimizing collection routes and providing user guidance on proper disposal.
Predictive Analytics: AI analyzes waste generation patterns to help urban planners forecast future demands and design better waste management infrastructure. 
This systematic sorting is a crucial first step in effective waste management and promoting a circular economy.
